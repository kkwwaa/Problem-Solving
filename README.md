My solutions to coding problems with explanations (LeetCode, Codeforces, acmp, Olympiads, etc.).

# Problem Solving by kkwwaa

Welcome to my coding challenges repository! Here, I solve problems from LeetCode, Codeforces, and olympiads, with detailed explanations. Built to showcase my algorithmic and DevOps skills.

## Topics
- [Arrays](Arrays/)
- [Graphs](Graphs/)
- [Dynamic Programming](DynamicProgramming/)
- [Sums](Sums/)
- [Strings](Strings/)
- [Trees](Trees/)
  

## How to Navigate
- Each problem has a `README.md` with the problem statement.
- Solutions are in `solution.py` or `solution.cpp` with comments.
- Use GitHub tags (`easy`, `python`) or folder structure to filter.
