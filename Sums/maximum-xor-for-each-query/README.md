# 1829. maximum-xor-for-each-query

[Description!](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-for-each-query/description/)

You are given a sorted array nums of n non-negative integers and an integer maximumBit. You want to perform the following query n times:

Find a non-negative integer k < 2 maximumBit such that nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[nums.length-1] XOR k is maximized. k is the answer to the ith query.
Remove the last element from the current array nums.
Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
